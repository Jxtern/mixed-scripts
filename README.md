# README - GitHub Mixed Scripts

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This collection of scripts is something I made just for fun, and most of them aren't related to each other.

Scripts that are related will be placed in a folder and categorized under **"projects"**.

All other random scripts will be placed in either **"part1"** or **"part2"** if the collection grows too large.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute if you'd like!

‚≠ê If you find anything useful, consider starring the repository!
